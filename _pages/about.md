I received my Master's degree from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)(USTC) in June 2025, advised by Prof. [Mengxiao Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/mengxiaozhu/home?authuser=0) and Prof. [Jiahong Yuan](https://openreview.net/profile?id=%7EJiahong_Yuan1). I received my B.E. in Materials Science & Engineering from the [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.hit.edu.cn) (HIT). I gained valuable industry experience as an intern at [Baidu's ERNIE Bot team](https://research.baidu.com/Blog/index-view?id=183), focusing on large language models.

My research leverages cross-disciplinary insights from Computational Social Science, Social NLP, and Explainable AI to tackle complex questions surrounding social phenomena and human behavior.



Currently, I am continuing my research with Prof. Jiahong Yuan at USTC while actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026 in Computational Social Science.

Research Interests 
======

**Computational Social Science**: I investigate how different communication modalities (text, audio, video) shape distinct public health narratives and sentiment patterns on social media, using the HPV vaccine as a key case study.


**Speech and Language for Clinical Informatics**: I develop and apply computational methods to analyze speech patterns, aiming to identify linguistic biomarkers for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.


**Explainable AI**: I apply Explainable AI (XAI) methods to uncover and address performance gaps in clinical diagnostic models, aiming to build more robust, fair, and trustworthy systems for healthcare.
