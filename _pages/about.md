I received my Master's degree from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)(USTC) in June 2025, advised by Prof. [Mengxiao Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/mengxiaozhu/home?authuser=0)  and Prof. [Jiahong Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jbbXJOkAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my B.E. in Materials Science & Engineering from the [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.hit.edu.cn) (HIT). I gained valuable industry experience as an intern at [Baidu's ERNIE Bot team](https://research.baidu.com/Blog/index-view?id=183), focusing on large language models.

My primary research interests are in *Computational Social Science, Social NLP,and Explainable AI*. I leverage these cross-disciplinary insights to tackle complex questions surrounding social phenomena and human behavior.

Currently, I am continuing my research with Prof. Jiahong Yuan at USTC while actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026 in Computational Social Science.

Research Interests
======

**Social Media Analysis for Public Health**: I analyze large-scale, multimodal data (text, audio, video) from social media to understand public discourse on critical health topics, such as the HPV vaccine.

**Speech and Language for Clinical Informatics**: I develop and apply computational methods to analyze speech patterns, aiming to identify linguistic biomarkers for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. 


**Explainable AI**
