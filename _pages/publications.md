  This paper, which forms the core of my [Master’s thesis](https://github.com/Heliumnm/heliumnm.github.io/blob/master/_data/Liu_He_Master_s_Thesis_Written_in_Chinese.pdf) supervised by Prof. Mengxiao Zhu, was accepted as an **Oral Presentation** (Lightning Talk) in the January 2025 submission cycle as a direct accept (conditional accept, no R&R). The review process was unusually rigorous, involving **five reviewers and one Senior Program Committee (SPC) member**, to whom I submitted a **49-page response** addressing all concerns. The SPC meta-review praised the “super strong” review process and how the paper was made “much stronger,” concluding it was “a clear accept.” [(**Jan 2025 direct-accept rate: 18/187 ≈ 9.8%.**)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q7_ta3G0Y3DwrCR8szs4tadyoEuU_0cz/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1)
