I go by **Helium** because it sounds like my Chinese name **何浏 (Hé Liú)**. During my undergraduate studies, I took many chemistry and physics courses and became very familiar with helium.

Outside of research, I enjoy **playing tennis** 🎾 and **swimming** 🏊. I’ve been doing both regularly for the past three years.

I really enjoy **indie music**, and lately my favorite album is [*Illinois*](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7514-illinois/) by **Sufjan Stevens**.
