Beyond my own research, I am passionate about teaching and mentorship. I find deep satisfaction in helping students connect complex theories to real-world applications and find their own academic paths.

## Teaching Assistantship

* Teaching Assistant, Speech Analysis, University of Science and Technology of China, Fall 2024.
* Teaching Assistant, Health Communication, University of Science and Technology of China, Fall 2022.

##  Community & Peer Mentorship

**Co-founder & Peer Mentor, USTC360 (2022–Present)**
* Co-founded this volunteer-run, non-profit platform and personally maintained its core operations (including weekly JD posting) for over two years, growing the community to 2,000+ members.
* Offered informal 1-on-1 guidance to many students, helping them discover their underlying passions and navigate the pivot from traditional science (e.g., Physics, Chemistry) into AI and related internship opportunities.

  

**A Note on Peer Mentorship**
* **The Context:**  I believe deeply in sharing my own cross-disciplinary journey from Engineering to Computational Social Science with students who are standing at a similar crossroads.
* **The Action:** I met [**Buyu Deng**](https://buyudeng.github.io/) (SGY '23) on the tennis court during his first week at USTC. I encouraged him to explore his passion for modeling beyond his traditional physics track. Drawing on my own research, I introduced him to computational and AI-driven approaches for scientific question, helping him see how data-driven methods could deepen our understanding of natural systems. Together, we identified the Geophysics major as a strong fit for his interests, and I connected him with a computational research group much earlier than is typical, which he then contacted and joined on his own initiative.

* **The Outcome:** He made the switch and has absolutely thrived. I've been thrilled to see him not only become a top-ranked undergraduate researcher, but also earn many Scholarships and now aim for top-tier PhD programs and summer research.
