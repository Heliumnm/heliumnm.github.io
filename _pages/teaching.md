Beyond my own research, I am passionate about teaching and mentorship. I find deep satisfaction in helping students connect complex theories to real-world applications and find their own academic paths.

##  Community & Peer Mentorship

**Co-founder & Peer Mentor, USTC360 (2022â€“Present)**
* Co-founded this volunteer-run, non-profit platform and personally maintained its core operations (including weekly JD posting) for over two years, growing the community to 2,000+ members.
* Offered informal 1-on-1 guidance to many students, helping them discover their underlying passions and navigate the pivot from traditional science (e.g., Physics, Materials) into AI and related internship opportunities.

  
**A Note on Peer Mentorship**
* **The Context:** I believe strongly in sharing my own cross-disciplinary experience (Engineering-to-CSS) with students facing a similar fork in the road.
* **The Action:** I met [**Buyu Deng**](https://buyudeng.github.io/) (SGY '23) on the tennis court during his first week at USTC. I encouraged him to explore his core passion for *modeling* beyond the confines of his traditional (and highly competitive) physics track. I helped him identify the Geophysics program as a perfect fit, introduced him to some AI fundamentals, and helped him connect with a computational research group far earlier than is typical for undergraduates.
* **The Outcome:** He made the switch and has absolutely thrived. I've been thrilled to see him not only become a top-ranked undergraduate researcher in that computational group, but also earn the Zhao Jiuzhang Scholarship and now aim for top-tier PhD programs and summer research.
