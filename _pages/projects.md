Language Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease, from Sociolinguistic, Patholinguistic, and Artificial Intelligence Perspectives. National Social Science Fund Project (23YYA01185)
------

Advisors: [Dr. Jiahong Yuan (PI)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jbbXJOkAAAAJ&hl=en)(Professor, USTC), Dr. Yizhe Wang (Postdoc, USTC), [Dr. Yiya Chen](https://www.ae-info.org/ae/Member/Chen_Yiya) (Professor, Leiden University, Member of Academia Europaea, who co-advised this project during her tenure as a Visiting Professor at USTC (Fall 2024))

This foundational research project is dedicated to establishing the core methodology and creating a high-quality resource for studying language biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease in Mandarin speakers. In contrast to application-focused modeling, the primary goal here is to build a comprehensive speech corpus, analogous to the renowned English DementiaBank, that will serve as a bedrock for future clinical and computational research in the field.

[Collected Data System](https://www.ustcphonetics.cloud/main)

- Co-developed a comprehensive suite of eight speech tasks grounded in patholinguistics. These tasks were specifically engineered to precisely elicit and capture the nuanced cognitive and linguistic variations characteristic of Mandarin speakers with cognitive decline. Built and deployed a robust, web-based data collection platform (ustcphonetics.cloud). This work established a standardized and scalable tool for acquiring high-quality, remote data, forming the technical backbone of this foundational study.

- Investigated how sociolinguistic factors influence the perception of speech from individuals with Alzheimer's Disease.

- Collaborated as part of a research team in the ICASSP 2025 Dementia Detection Challenge

AI-Powered Cognitive Impairment Screening via Speech and Language Analysis. Applied Research & System Development
------
In collaboration with iFlytek, BUPT Digital Intelligence (Beidian Shuzhi), and Beijing Tiantan Hospital (Ranked #1 in Neurology in China)

An ongoing research project to develop a novel, non-invasive screening tool for cognitive health, aiming for dual outcomes of academic publication and commercial application. The project leverages a unique, large-scale dataset from ~4,000 individuals, featuring multimodal data including speech, text, performance on linguistic tasks, and lifestyle habits. The primary objective is to build and validate AI models to classify various types of cognitive decline (e.g., Cognitive Decline with Alzheimer's - CDA, Non-Alzheimer's - CDN, and Vascular - CDV).

This was a large-scale research project that performed a cross-modality analysis of HPV vaccine discourse on social media. The study involved collecting and analyzing over 1.5TB of data, including texts, audios, and videos from major platforms like Weibo, Douyin, and Bilibili, spanning a decade from 2010 to 2023. The goal was to understand how the same vaccine was discussed differently across various media formats.
