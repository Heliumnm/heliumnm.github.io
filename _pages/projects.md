Language Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease, from Sociolinguistic, Patholinguistic, and Artificial Intelligence Perspectives. National Social Science Fund Project (23YYA01185)
------

Advisors: [Dr. Jiahong Yuan (PI)](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Jiahong_Yuan1)(Professor, USTC), Dr. Yizhe Wang (Postdoc, USTC), [Dr. Yiya Chen](https://www.ae-info.org/ae/Member/Chen_Yiya) (Professor, Leiden University, Member of Academia Europaea, who co-advised this project during her tenure as a Visiting Professor at USTC (Fall 2024))

This foundational research is dedicated to establishing the core methodology and creating a high-quality speech corpus for studying language biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease in Mandarin speakers. The goal is to build a resource analogous to the English DementiaBank, serving as a bedrock for future clinical and computational research.

[Collected Data System](https://www.ustcphonetics.cloud/main)

- Experimental Design: Co-developed a comprehensive suite of eight speech tasks grounded in patholinguistics to precisely elicit and capture the linguistic variations of Mandarin speakers with cognitive decline.
- Infrastructure Development: Built and deployed a robust, web-based data collection platform, establishing a standardized tool for high-quality remote data acquisition.
- Sociolinguistic Analysis: Investigated how sociolinguistic factors influence the perception of speech from individuals with Alzheimer's Disease.
- Collaborated as part of a research team in the ICASSP 2025 Dementia Detection Challenge

AI-Powered Cognitive Impairment Screening via Speech and Language Analysis. Applied Research & System Development
------
In collaboration with iFlytek, BUPT Digital Intelligence (Beidian Shuzhi), and Beijing Tiantan Hospital (Ranked #1 in Neurology in China)

An ongoing research project to develop a novel, non-invasive screening tool for cognitive health, aiming for dual outcomes of academic publication and commercial application. The project leverages a unique, large-scale dataset from ~4,000 individuals, featuring multimodal data including speech, text, performance on linguistic tasks, and lifestyle habits. The primary objective is to build and validate AI models to classify various types of cognitive decline (e.g., Cognitive Decline with Alzheimer's - CDA, Non-Alzheimer's - CDN, and Vascular - CDV).

This was a large-scale research project that performed a cross-modality analysis of HPV vaccine discourse on social media. The study involved collecting and analyzing over 1.5TB of data, including texts, audios, and videos from major platforms like Weibo, Douyin, and Bilibili, spanning a decade from 2010 to 2023. The goal was to understand how the same vaccine was discussed differently across various media formats.

  This paper, which forms the core of my Master’s thesis supervised by Prof. Mengxiao Zhu, was accepted as an **Oral Presentation** (Lightning Talk) in the January 2025 submission cycle as a direct accept (conditional accept, no R&R). The review process was unusually rigorous, involving **five reviewers and one Senior Program Committee (SPC) member**, to whom I submitted a **49-page response addressing all concerns**. The SPC meta-review concluded that the paper was “a clear accept.” (**Jan 2025 direct-accept rate: 18/187 ≈ 9.8%.**)
